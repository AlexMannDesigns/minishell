# minishell
My very own shell program.

To deepen my understanding of Unix systems I have built a very basic implementation of a shell, using bash as a reference.

To compile and the program, simply run the command: "make; make clean". You can then run the program with: "./minishell".

You'll then be greeted with a title, and will be able to run commands as you would in a "normal" Unix shell:

Please note, this program does not feature cursor control and will only handle basic commands. Piping, redirects, logical operators and semicolons (to name a few features) are not supported.
